# DuelSys

- DuelSys wants to host badminton tournaments, but they need a reliable system to mainly keep track of their players and tournaments, which at this point they do not have. They have tasked us to create one where they are able to manually add tournaments by their staffs, manage their tournaments and players, add/remove players and tournament in the system.

- DuelSys also wants their players to create an account through their website. They want the players to register themselves to the tournaments which they are interested in.
  We will be making it possible for Media Bazaar to manage their employees, schedule their employees and manage products.
